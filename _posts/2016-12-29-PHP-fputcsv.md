title: ! 'PHP: fputcsv'
---

PHP has a function to format some input as a comma-separated sequence of values and write it to an open file handle.

It's called [fputcsv](http://php.net/manual/en/function.fputcsv.php).

PHP does not have a function to perform this same operation without writing it to a file handle.
