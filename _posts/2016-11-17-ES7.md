title: That word you're using&#58; ES7

I don't think you know what it means.

ES2016 (ES7) has a very [well-defined](http://www.2ality.com/2016/01/ecmascript-2016.html) set of features. The edition is shipped! Finalized! Implemented, even!

These features are not part of ES2016:

- async/await
- decorators
- object spread
- bind operator

The widespread labeling of these features as "ES7 features" is strange.
